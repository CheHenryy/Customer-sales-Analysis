# Customer sales Analysis 
This repository contains analysis of product and sales data from a AdventureWorks2025 database using sql and python. 
## Folders
This repository consist of two folders: Data and Scripts.
The data folder consists of SQL statements used to extract data for each visualisation aimed at answering a specific business question.
The scripts folder consist of the report file that hold the python code, figures and a brief description of the figures. 

### Structure 
The report notebook begins with importing the necessary libraries and connecting to the SQL server. Following this is a function that takes the SQL statments and returns a
dataframe that will be used in making different visualisations using searborn. 

For each visualisation, I begin with the main goal, followed by the specific business question i wish to answer, the tables from the AdventureWorks2025 database that was used and lastly, a brief description of the resulting figure.
